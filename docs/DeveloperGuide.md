## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280"></puml>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores `Schedule` objects as a separate list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Schedule>` that can be observed.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below.
It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references.
This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.
A similar model can be used for `JobRole` as well.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="500" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage`, and `ScheduleBoardStorage` which means it can be treated as either of the three (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<box type="info" header="**Note**">

`Candidate` are referred to as `Person` throughout the codebase due to legacy design choices.
</box>

### Add Candidate and Add Interview Schedule feature
The Add Candidate and Add Schedule features both adhere to the Logic Component format described [above](#logic-component) and share a similar implementation structure. 
As an example, below is the sequence diagram for the Add Candidate command when the user inputs:
`add n/Vish p/1293123 e/sample@domain.com a/213123 street j/ProData guy l/Rejected`
<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />

<box type="info" header="**Note**">

The implementation of the Add Schedule feature is similar to that of the example given above. However, instead of calling `hasPerson(...)`, `hasJobRoles(...)`, and `addPerson(...)` methods,
the methods `hasSameDateTime(...)` and `addSchedule(...)`  in Model component will be called for adding a schedule.
</box>


### Edit Candidate and Edit Interview Schedule feature
The Edit Candidate and Edit Interview Schedule features both adhere to the Logic Component format described [above](#logic-component) and share a similar implementation structure.
As an example, below is the sequence diagram for the Edit Candidate command when the user inputs:
`edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`
<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />

<box type="info" header="**Note**">

The implementation of the Edit Schedule feature is similar to that of the example given above. However,
the methods `createEditedSchedule(...)`, `hasSameDateTimeEdit(...)`, `setSchedule(...)`, and `updateFilteredScheduleList(...)` in Model component will be called for editing a schedule.
</box>

### Delete Candidate and Delete Interview Schedule feature
The Delete Candidate and Delete Schedule features both adhere to the Logic Component format described [above](#logic-component) and share a similar implementation structure.
As an example, below is the sequence diagram for the Delete Candidate command when the user inputs:
`delete 1`
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />

<box type="info" header="**Note**">

The implementation of the Delete Schedule feature is similar to that of the example given above. However, instead of calling `getFilteredPersonList()` and `deletePerson(...)` methods,
the methods `getFilteredScheduleList()` and `deleteSchedule(...)`  in Model component will be called for deleting a schedule.
</box>

### List Candidates/Interview Schedules and Clear Candidates/Interview Schedules feature
The List and Clear Candidate/Interview Schedules commands deviate slightly from the Logic Component format [above](#logic-component) because they require no arguments and thus bypass the `Parser`. Since both commands follow the same flow, we’ll illustrate only the sequence diagram for the Clear Candidates command when the user enters:
`clear`
<puml src="diagrams/ClearSequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />

Main execution steps:

1. User Input: The user enters `clear` to clear all candidates.

2. Parsing: `LogicManager` calls `parseCommand("clear")` on `AddressBookParser`.

3. Command Creation: `AddressBookParser` recognizes the `clear` command and directly instantiates `ClearCommand` (no arguments to parse).

4. Execution: `LogicManager` invokes `execute(model)` on the `ClearCommand`.

5. Listing: `ClearCommand` clear the current candidate list and updates the model.

6. Result: `ClearCommand` returns a `CommandResult` indicating success, which `LogicManager` then propagates back to the UI.

<box type="info" header="**Note**">

The implementation of the List Candidates feature is similar to that of the example given above. However, instead of `setAddressBook(...)` method of the Model Component being called, `updateFilteredPersonList(...)` is called. 
For Listing and Clearing schedules, the methods `updateFilteredScheduleList(...)` and `setScheduleBoard(...)` in Model component will be called respectively.
</box>

### Storing data manually

The `Storage` component is used to save data automatically whenever a change to the data occurs. While the same
component _can_ be used to store data manually, there are some limitations:

- Since `Storage` inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `ScheduleBoardStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, any class implementing `Storage` will have to
  adhere to the contracts of all three interfaces. While it makes sense for the general scope of the application, it doesn't make sense
  when the user only wishes to save data to a particular location at a particular point in time (and they do not necessarily wish to permanently save
  the data to this chosen location).
- A workaround will be to implement the methods of `UserPrefsStorage`, and return dummy values like `Optional#empty()` for `readUserPrefs()` or an empty String for `getUserPrefsFilePath()`<br>
  - But this sounds more like we are forced to adhere to the contract of `UserPrefsStorage`.
- The alternative will be to create a new storage component for manual storage: `ManualStorage`
  - This interface will inherit from only `AddressBookStorage` and `ScheduleBoardStorage`.
  - A separate manager class, `ManualStorageManager`, will implement `ManualStorage` and implement methods for reading and writing data pertaining to candidates and interview schedules.
  - While this looks very similar to `Storage` and `StorageManager`, the benefit is that, to store data manually, classes and objects no longer have to worry about dealing with user preferences.
- The class diagram below depicts the relationship described:
<puml src="diagrams/ManualStorageClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />

### The theme command

The `theme` command is used to change the theme of the GUI to either light or dark theme. <br>
The `theme` command was implemented _after_ the theme button.

- This command is implemeted using the `themeCommand` and `Theme` classes and it is similar to the handling of the other commands to some extent.
- Implementation:
  - It makes use command architecture that other components also use. It has its seperate `themeCommandParser` class and the
    `themeCommand`class's exectue method returns a `commandResult`.
  - This is handled by the logic component similar to the rest however in the below PML diagram the UI-Logic interaction is also shown
    below as it is actually the MainWindow class that is responsible for resetting the stylesheets using its handleTheme() method, which is why the UI component
    was included here as oppossed to other diagrams like that of the deleteCommand.
  - It is also good to note that it is saved the same way that `GUISettings` are saved through the `UserPrefs` class along with relevant methods to execute the same.                         

![Theme Command](images/themeCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

- The foundation for this feature has already been laid in v1.5.
- With the introduction of the save feature, the user already has a way of archiving data that they wish to.
- However, improvements could be made to better enhance the archive feature.
- Here are some improvements that can help to improve this feature (this list is not exhaustive):
  - Update the displayed list of candidates to indicate which candidates have been archived (for the user's reference)
  - Have a unique archive name format that contains the date (and perhaps time) on which the archive was performed
  - Have a separate command for simply archiving user data
    - This could act as an alias for a specialised use case of the `save` command

   1. Prerequisites: You should have sufficient write permissions to the file path you are saving the data to.

   1. Test case: `save c/candidates.json s/schedules.json`<br>
      - Expected (if both files do not exist): Two json files, `[JAR file location]/candidates.json` and `[JAR file location]/schedules.json`, should be created with the corresponding filtered candidates and schedules data respectively.
      - Expected (if `[JAR file location]/candidates.json` exists): An error message specifying that `[JAR file location]/candidates.json` exists.
      - Expected (if `[JAR file location]/schedules.json`): An error message specifying that `[JAR file location]/schedules.json` exists.
      - Expected (if both files exist): An error message specifying that `[JAR file location]/candidates.json` exists.

## **Appendix: Effort**
* **Difficulty level:** 
QuickHire is considerably challenging because of the integration of additional entities and the complexity of managing the relationships between them.

* **Challenges faced:** 
  - Additional entity: The project introduces new entity `Schedule` and connects it with `Person` through `Name` and `Email`.
  - Feature Development: To support the new Schedule entity, we had to develop several new core features, such as adding schedule, editing schedule, deleting schedule, listing schedule and clearing schedule.
  - User Interface Enhancements: To make the application more intuitive and user‑friendly, we revamped the GUI—adding dedicated schedule sections and refining the overall design for a smoother, more cohesive experience.

* **Effort required:**
  - We estimate the project demanded as equal as the anticipated effort because of the added entities and expanded features. 
  To ensure robustness and maintainability, we prioritized comprehensive testing and strict adherence to coding standards. Driven by passion and a commitment to learning, we consistently went the extra mile throughout development.
* **Achievements:** 
  - Introduce new schedule features that allow user to create and maintain interview schedules for candidates.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Team size: 5

1. Restrict interview dates to a reasonable range. Currently, users can schedule interviews for dates very far in the past or future. We plan to apply a constraint that the user may only schedule interview date that is within 20 years before or after current date.
2. The current implementation cannot verify whether an interview that spans midnight (i.e., crosses two consecutive days) has a duration between 15 minutes and 4 hours. We plan to add a check to ensure that any interview for the same candidate crossing into the next day also falls within that 15‑minute to 4‑hour window.
